RomanNumerals
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lpil/roman-numerals.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/lpil/roman-numerals)

Convert numbers to Roman numerals and back.

## Usage

Add Dogma to your Mix dependencies

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    {:roman_numerals, "~> 1.0"},
  ]
end
```

And then use `RomanNumerals.encode/1` and `RomanNumerals.decode/1` in your
application for all that numeral goodness. :)


```elixir
RomanNumerals.encode 1991
# => "MCMXCI"

RomanNumerals.decode "XCVII"
# => 97
```
